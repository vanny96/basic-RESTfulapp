# basic-RESTfulapp

With this project I'm trying to make a very simple RESTfull web app in order to practice what I've learnt about spring until now. Every time I'll need to practice something I think I'll come here.

## Functionalities

Right now the webapp isn't usable outside of mine development enviroment, if you want to test it you'll need to change the Database properties in the src/main/resources/application.properties file

Once set up, using Postman or similar programs you will be able to manage users and their posts!
